### Hello! I'm Danielle!

 A Software Engineer with a background in electronics. I possess a deep curiousity for how things work and figuring out ways to inprove the functionality of those things. 
 
 I work with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to develop responsive, well designed, and well tested applications.
 
 When Iâ€™m not coding or tinkering with things, you can find me playing with my dogs, hanging with my family, or learning new rhythms on my drum set.
